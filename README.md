# Animal-monitoring
This project implements a cost-effective RFID-based animal monitoring system to track livestock health and location in real-time. It integrates NodeMCU, GPS, ECG sensor, and Firebase for data management, with offline data transmission via Bluetooth. The system enhances animal traceability, health monitoring, and data accessibility for farmers.
