# Animal-monitoring
This project implements a cost-effective RFID-based animal monitoring system to track livestock health and location in real-time. It integrates NodeMCU, GPS, ECG sensor, and Firebase for data management, with offline data transmission via Bluetooth. The system enhances animal traceability, health monitoring, and data accessibility for farmers.

RFID-Based Animal Monitoring System:-

The RFID-Based Animal Monitoring System leverages RFID technology, GPS, and ECG sensors to monitor and track animal data in real time. The system uses an ESP8266 (NodeMCU) to transmit data to a Firebase server, while an Arduino Nano and RC522 RFID reader capture unique identification data from RFID tags. Offline data transmission is handled by an HC-05 Bluetooth module. The data, including location, pulse rate, and other vital information, is accessible through a MIT App Inventor-based Android application, enabling users to monitor registered animals effectively. This project addresses the need for real-time monitoring and management of animal health and location, particularly in remote areas.
